                    This project maps many popular art museums around the globe. 
                    Consistently, Musée du Louvre, located in Paris, France, 
                    has been the most visited art museum. Established in 1793, 
                    it houses some of the world’s most famous artwork, including 
                    the elusive Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo, and Winged Victory 
                    of Samothrace (pictured left). Around 190 BC, Winged Victory was 
                    made as an offering to the gods on the Greek Island of Samothrace. 
                    The statue is made of fine marble, representing Nike, the goddess of Victory.

                    The Musei Vaticani, located within the Vatican City, are also highly 
                    visited. These museums feature several renowned, quintessential 
                    Renaissance masterpieces, such as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel and 
                    the School of Athens (pictured right). The School of Athens, a fresco 
                    by Raphael, was finished in 1511 as a part of Raphael's commision to decorate
                    the rooms now known as the Raphael Rooms. This painting is often studied as one of 
                    the pinnacles of Renaissance art, as it borrows ideas from Ancient Greek philosophy and
                    other classical templates.

                The interactive map below is styled after the Gallery of Maps 
                in the Musei Vaticani. This gallery contains a series of painted 
                topographical maps commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII in the late 
                16th century. The walls of the gallery are covered with forty 
                different maps of various Italian regions, and the ceiling above 
                each map illustrates the major religious events of that area. The 
                maps showcase exquisitely beautiful, opulent detail. While this 
                ornamentation may not be possible to recreate as a Mapbox tileset, 
                some of the color palette, font styles, and textures are represented.

            The interactive map also hosts several helpful features. The sequence 
            bar on the left allows one to sequence through 7 different time stamps 
            from 2015-2021. Clicking on each red proportional symbol will call a 
            pop-up with information about that museum. Generally, the data reveal 
            that museum attendance has flourished rapidly over time, only to be 
            majorly halted by many museum closures during the start of the pandemic 
            in 2020, and art museums have since struggled to regain solid visitation numbers. 
            This map data was sourced from the annual reports that these museums have 
            published. Unfortunately, many smaller, less popular museums had to be left 
            off this map, as their reports are not published publicly.
