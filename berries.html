                Quickberry quackberry, pick me a blackberry! The title, color scheme, and graphics 
                used in this project are all borrowed or inspired by the iconic children's book <i>Jamberry</i> 
                by Bruce Degen. As a child, this was one of my favorite books. The illustration style 
                is the perfect amount of fantastical and whimsical, while still maintaining crucial 
                elements of reality. The various colorways of the book are what I love the most about it - many 
                rich and lively colors are represented. The story itself follows the playful odyssey of a homely 
                bear and boy as they experience activities ripe with berries. In my opinion (all of my opinions 
                are objective and based in scientific research), <i>Jamberry</i> is a simple idea wittily enhanced
                by weaving together masterful illustrations and clever rhymes.

                The data in this project show different types of berry acreages, mapped by state (only the
                contiguous United States is shown, particularly because Hawaii and Alaska do not grow many
                berries). These data were obtained from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, and 
                each berry attribute is from 2017. The shapefiles used to express the United States are from
                Natural Earth.

                Take a look around the map and the coordinated chart - hovering over each state
                will reveal the specific acreage grown for the berries, and the dropdown menu offers 
                the opportunity to select different berries!
